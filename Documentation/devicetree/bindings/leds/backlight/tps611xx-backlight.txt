TPS611xx family of backlight driver based on EasyScale.

EasyScale is a simple but flexible one pin interface to configure the current.

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain at least one of
  "ti,tps61158_bl"
  "ti,tps61161_bl"
  "ti,tps61163_bl"
  "ti,tps61165_bl"
- rfa-enable: enable request for acknowledge.
  If RFA is enabled, the data byte includes the RFA bit and device will wait
  and check acknowledge from device.
- es-gpio : GPIO for easy-scale communication.(see GPIO binding[0])

Example:

	backlight {
		compatible = "ti,tps61163";
		rfa-enable;
		es-gpio = <&gpio 45 0>;
	};
