TPS65217 Charger

Required Properties:
-compatible: "ti,tps65217-charger"
-interrupts: TPS65217 interrupt numbers for the AC and USB charger input change.
             Should be <0> for the USB charger and <1> for the AC adapter.
-interrupt-names: Should be "USB" and "AC"

This node is a subnode of the tps65217 PMIC.

Optional properties:
- tps65217,mux-out: The voltage input that goes to the MUX_OUT pin. Possible
values are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 as per the table below:

0: MUX_OUT is put in High Impedance
1: MUX_OUT = VBAT
2: MUX_OUT = VSYS
3: MUX_OUT = VTS
4: MUX_OUT = VICH
5: MUX_OUT = MUX_IN

Example:

	tps65217-charger {
		compatible = "ti,tps65217-charger";
		interrupts = <0>, <1>;
		interrupt-names = "USB", "AC";
		tps65217,mux-out = <1>;	/* MUX_OUT = VBAT */
	};
