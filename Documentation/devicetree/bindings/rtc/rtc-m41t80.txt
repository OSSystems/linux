ST M41T80 family of RTC and compatible

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of:
	"st,m41t62",
	"st,m41t65",
	"st,m41t80",
	"st,m41t81",
	"st,m41t81s",
	"st,m41t82",
	"st,m41t83",
	"st,m41t84",
	"st,m41t85",
	"st,m41t87",
	"microcrystal,rv4162",
- reg: I2C bus address of the device

Optional properties:
- interrupts: rtc alarm interrupt.
- clock-output-names: From common clock binding to override the default output
                      clock name
- wakeup-source: Enables wake up of host system on alarm
- st,use-tamper1: Use the TP1IN pin as tamper functionality. If not present,
TP1N pin is not used as tamper.
- st,use-tamper2: Use the TP2IN pin as tamper functionality. If not present,
TP2N pin is not used as tamper.
- st,tp1in-normally-open: Use TP1IN pin as a normally open switch. If not
present, use it as a normally closed switch.
- st,tp2in-normally-open: Use TP2IN pin as a normally open switch. If not
present, use it as a normally closed switch.
- st,tp1in-high: Detect TP1IN tamper event when it switches from low to high.
If not present, detect the tamper event when TP1IN changes from high to low.
- st,tp2in-high: Detect TP2IN event event when it switches from low to high.
If not present, detect the tamper event when TP2IN changes from high to low.

Example:
	rtc@68 {
		compatible = "st,m41t80";
		reg = <0x68>;
		interrupt-parent = <&UIC0>;
		interrupts = <0x9 0x8>;
	};
